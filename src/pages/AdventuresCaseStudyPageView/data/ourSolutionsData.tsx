      `Besides revamping the website and navigation, Onix introduced a fresh visual identity
      for 10Adventures, incorporating an X-shaped element into the new logo. The X serves a
      dual purpose, representing the Roman numeral 10, symbolizing the core identity of 10Adventures,
      and resembling a mark on a hiking or treasure map, alluding to the essence of adventurous exploration.`,
      `Moreover, the X shape carries a deeper meaning by referencing the concept of
      'unknown' (e.g., Planet X), connecting the symbol with the spirit of destinations,
      exploration, and discoveries. This innovative logo design encapsulates the brand's
      adventurous spirit and sense of mystery, reinforcing the platform's identity and
      enhancing its visual appeal.`,
