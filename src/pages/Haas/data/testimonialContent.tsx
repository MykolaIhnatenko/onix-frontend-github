    Their developers are very experienced, insightful, easy to work with and have great communication skills.
    The Onix team did a great job with helping build our flagship iOS apps called Haas Service and MyHaas.
    <br />
    <br />
    When it was time to launch an Android version of the Haas Service App, it was extremely easy and fast to
    onboard a new Android developer. He worked directly with the original Onix iOS developer and we were able
    to launch the Android version of the app very quickly.  We are very happy to continue to work with Onix for
    the foreseeable future.
