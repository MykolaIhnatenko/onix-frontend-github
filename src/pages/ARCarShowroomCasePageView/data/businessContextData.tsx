  title: 'When the client first sat down with Onix, their need was simple but ambitious.',
  subTitle: `The automotive retailer’s physical space was limited, making it challenging to showcase their full range
    of luxury cars. Their customers were often left without the chance to see, let alone interact with,
    certain high-end models.`,
  firstText: `They came to Onix with a vision: create a virtual showroom where customers could experience
    these cars up close, customize them, and even feel the thrill of a test drive—all through VR.`,
  secondText: `“We wanted to give customers more than just a visual experience—we wanted them to feel like
    they were interacting with the car, even if it wasn’t physically there,” explained Mykola Makarevich, Onix’s CMTO.`,
  bottomText: `This vision demanded not just innovation but a seamless blend of high-end technology,
    thoughtful design, and an understanding of what customers wanted to feel in their car-buying journey.`,
