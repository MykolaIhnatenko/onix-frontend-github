        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        On the app store there are lots of mobile apps meant to help users
        learn about wine and teach them how
        to find a perfect match for the dinner. We at Onix were approached by
        &nbsp;
        <span className={wineCaseStyles.color_text}>
          Josselin Guibert
        </span>
        &nbsp;
        and
        &nbsp;
        <span className={wineCaseStyles.color_text}>
          Julien Sahut
        </span>
        , founders of Wine Collection Ltd., with the idea
        of building a unique service application, where users could make a perfect wine match while
        dining at a particular restaurant.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our customers came to us with the general app concept, though having most of the appâ€™s design
        prepared and some supporting documentation. Josselin Guibert has become the product manager and
        collaborated with us on all technical aspects of development. Julien Sahut, a sommelier working
        with restaurants in Europe, has developed the wine &#x3C;-&#x3E; food matching proprietary logic.
        <br />
        <br />
        Wine Picker was created to give the answer to a simple question:
        <br />
        <b>
          How do you pick wine in a restaurant you are in and match it with your food?
        </b>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
