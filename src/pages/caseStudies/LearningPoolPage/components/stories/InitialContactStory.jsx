              began communication on an IT job platform where Learning Pool was looking for contractors.
              The company was experiencing rapid growth and a large influx of customers, and
              therefore had a growing need for software developers. It wasn&apos;t practical to
              open
              new offices and recruit the right staff quickly in the UK, so they decided to
              outsource a part of the software development tasks.

              Onix&apos;s â€˜scouting group&apos; included three full-stack web developers and a
              project
              manager who acted as Learning Pool&apos;s eyes and ears in Ukraine. The team&apos;s
              primary
              goal was to build a relationship with the existing UK team, understand the project
              details, and proceed to the proper development as soon as possible. The PM had to
              facilitate the process and ensure a high level of quality.

              were able to start, Onix specialists went
              through a testing period that lasted six months. Learning Pool was looking for a
              long-term outsourcing partner, so they were keenly interested in all Onix&apos;s
              processes. Our managers walked them through every aspect, from the hiring procedure
              to the criteria for employee promotion, and from time management to learning process
              monitoring.
