    `“Onix was the ideal partner to get this project done - this became clear very early in the project
    tendering process when I quickly got the impression of their know-how, the work ethic
    and the collaborative culture they live.`,

    `Once we started to work, it was clear that they lived up to their promises and exceeded my
    expectations when they were very familiar with complex, country-specific laws and regulations
    from an early stage. Onix collaborates extremely well amongst their team members and the
    internal delivery processes are designed to perform.`,

    `After working with many in-house dev teams in major Swiss/Worldwide financial service providers over
    more than a decade, I can easily say that working with Onix was the biggest pleasure in all those projects.
    I highly recommend working with them if you want to get things done fast, thoroughly,
    in high quality and in a collaborative manner.”`,
