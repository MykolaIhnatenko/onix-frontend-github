    question: 'Deep research and competitor analysis',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Before designing new features, our team researched the fitness market along with
        existing solutions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Deep research gave us a couple of valuable insights into the proper user experience flow.
        It allowed our specialists to create designs that ultimately meet our clientâ€™s requirements and satisfy
        end-users.

    question: 'Optimized sign-up flow',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Registration is the very first and most crucial part of the user experience journey, where users
        create an account and start using a product. Since the sign-up flow is so important to increase conversion,
        we decided to simplify it.
        <br />
        <br />
        We made the registration process easier by adding the ability to sign up with Google, link the coach
        card before registration, and choose one of the required subscription plans. Streamlined sign-up flow
        allowed our clients to grow further and faster.

    question: 'Unified visual design system',
    answer: (
      <p>
        We needed to ensure the platform was visually pleasing and consistent in style and colors.
        To achieve that consistency,  we created a unified visual design system that keeps strong associations
        with the brand.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our designers made UI design visually cohesive, clean and minimalistic, with bright accent colors.

    question: 'Simple and intuitive navigation',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Navigation was one of the main challenges in the project since the app had to display a lot of data.
        Our specialists divided basic functionality into several logical parts to make navigation more
        straightforward. Thus we created an intuitive feed that provides the best experience to coaches and their
        clients.
        <br />
        <br />
        We built an intuitive interface that enables users to find the required feature effortlessly and access
        them quickly. Now it&apos;s super easy and convenient to coach digitally, track results, and visualize
        progress toward specific goals.
