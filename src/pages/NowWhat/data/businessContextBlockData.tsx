  title: `Dr. Zach Dovey has a wealth of experience in treating patients at some of the world's most
    renowned cancer centers, including those in France, Belgium, the UK, and the US.`,
  subtitle: `Through conversations with his patients, he recognized the lack of reliable, practical advice and
    emotional support available to them, and this inspired him to create NowWhat.`,
  firstText: `He wanted to create an algorithm-matched platform where people dealing with similar experiences –
    such as undergoing the same type of treatment or having a similar stage cancer – could connect for support.
    Zach also envisioned providing users with access to scientifically based advice concerning various topics,
    from treatments and lifestyle choices to diet tips.`,
  secondText: `For those whose medical appointments have stopped, NowWhat is designed to help manage side effects
    from treatment, cope with anxiety regarding cancer recurrence, and lead a healthy life afterward.
    By providing these resources, Zach hopes NowWhat can help make hard times easier for those affected
    by cancer.`,
  bottomText: `That’s how our client turned to the Onix team for assistance with website development
    for the cancer society.`,
