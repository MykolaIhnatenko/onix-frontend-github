            <p>
              For ten years, Diren Kartal, the fitness coach and the owner of Project X, has been conducting
              fitness training. Since Diren established Project X, he created a hybrid training environment,
              where he communicated with his clients using Aweber and Slack, and he tracked their results by
              means of Excel Tables. To some extent, Project X had been operated manually. That was inconvenient
              for both Diren and his clients.
              <br />
              Thatâ€™s how our client came up with the idea of the end-to-end fitness platform for online coaching.

              Diren chose Onix upon the recommendation of an existing client who also had a fitness project.
              So our client knew that Onix had the right expertise and a proven track record for fitness projects.
