          Starting your DevOps transformation journey can be done in a few different ways. The first step is
          understanding your current infrastructure and identifying what needs improvement. Once you understand
          the current state, you can look at the appropriate tools and processes needed for the transition.
          This should include selecting the right software development lifecycle model, such as Agile or Lean,
          for your organization. Additionally, itâ€™s essential to establish a culture of collaboration between
          IT and development teams so that everyone understands their roles and responsibilities. Finally,
          key performance indicators should be established to measure success against goals over time.

        <ContentText tag="p" className={`${textStyle} ${styles}`}>
          Implementing DevOps can provide many benefits for your business. First, DevOps helps to accelerate the
          software delivery process by automating manual tasks and providing continuous feedback loops between
          development, operations, and testing teams. This allows developers to respond quickly to customer
          feedback and produce new features in a shorter amount of time. In addition, DevOps also encourages
          collaboration between IT and development teams which leads to higher-quality software products.
          Finally, DevOps allows businesses to save costs while gaining better visibility into their infrastructure.
