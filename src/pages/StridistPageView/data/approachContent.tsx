    <p>
      At Onix, we use the Agile methodology to add more flexibility, speed, and quality to our development
      process. This development approach enables our team to make continuous improvements avoiding development
      issues and delays flexibly.

      From the first days of working on Stridist, it became clear that to make it successful on the market,
      we needed to make essential changes to the website architecture to solve issues
      with agility and scalability.
      <br />
      <br />
      That’s why we made it our top priority to build a new architecture and transfer the project to it.
      The new architecture would guarantee an ability to scale the product on demand,
      a smooth platform operation, and a pleasant user experience.
