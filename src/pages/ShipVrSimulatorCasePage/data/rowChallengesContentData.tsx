        For the sky, we worked on the effects that would allow making it immediately sunny when the sea
        {' '}

        is calm or making it cloudy once the storm arrives. To create water, we used a ready-to-use

        <br />
        pattern that was provided by Ingo, but we worked on the shades to add the sea depth and water

        reflections.

        The customer provided the design for the app, so our team was mostly focused on the

        development part. We added occasional changes to the design to ensure a smooth VR user
        {' '}
        <br />
        experience. Also, the Unity team designed and built the app’s interface, action buttons, and
        {' '}

        shaders.
