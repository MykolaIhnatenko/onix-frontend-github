    `People would have to check local tax calculators of different cantons, calculate their health insurance
    premium, and check other factors in many different places on the web for every place they consider moving
    to. It is already a burden for locals but especially complicated for people who are not familiar with
    the whole system.`,

    `We were requested to build a digital platform that offers unbiased and objective information about
    the Swiss taxation and insurance systems. Whether users are planning to move to Switzerland, living
    there, or are simply curious, this calculator has it all covered.`,
    `The website is committed to providing their users with the\u00A0most comprehensive and accurate information
    possible. The client recognizes that navigating through Swiss taxation and insurance policies can be
    overwhelming, which is why the platform idea appeared.`,
